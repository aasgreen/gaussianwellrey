This directory contains the code I have generated while working for the Rey group.

Primarily, I am looking at two gaussian wells; using mathematica to solve and generated matrices in the plane wave and harmonic oscillator basis.

Results: Convergence contains the majority of the 1D code.

2d: contains the beginning of the investigation into 2d

2dfork is a notebook produced for kaden, but has taken over prominance

Double well: is Adam (other adam's) code for generating this tunneling rates

Onside: I have started to look at plotting on the onsite interaction.
